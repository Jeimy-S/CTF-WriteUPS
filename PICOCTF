Logon: 
Logged into joes profile with the username being joe and the password * OR 1=1
Changed admin cookie to True and reloaded the page which gave me the flag

Login:
First I inspected the source file, did not see anything weird in the html file but there was a javascript linked there. I opened the file and found an encrypted password.
Put the password given in the javascript file in cypherchef which game the flag.

Matryoshka doll:
Used binwalk -e -C on the doll image
Then used binwalk Matryoshka on the second image which extracted all of the files 
Navigated to the last directory that was extracted from the 2nd image and found the flag text

Glory of the Garden:
Used exiftool garden and binwalk, both didn’t show a file hidden in the image
Then I used strings on the image and the flag appeared at the end of the printed string

Mind your Ps and Qs:
Tried solving it the mathematical way, didn’t understand what was happening
Searched for a RSA decryptor, plugged in the values which were given, and received the flag.

The Numbers:
The numbers that where in the image matched with the alphabet, since I already know the pattern of the flags I know the first 7 letters are picoCTF, this corroborated with the numbers
